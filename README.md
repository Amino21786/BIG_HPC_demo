# Template HPC repository to run large-scale simulations - BIG meeting - 13/01/2026
## Setting up on Nimbus for use of CPU and GPU instances in Python
Aim for everyone to be set up on Nimbus and be able to run Python scripts (e.g. Optimisation algorithm simulation over many iterations for an inverse problem)


Files:
- process.py - where the main code for the simulation exists (the core code that you would usually run on your own machine)
-
